"""Compute the volume of a sphere with a radius of 5. The formula for a sphere is 4⁄3πr3. Note: The answer is around 500, not 400 (in case you are using Python 2).
Write a function sphere_volume that returns the volume of a sphere when given radius r as a parameter. Then write a main program that calls sphere_volume to print the volume of a sphere with a radius of 5. Should the print statement go in the sphere_volume or the main program?"""
